# 🛠️ Gas Leakage Detection and Alerting System 🛠️

## 📖 Overview
Gas leakage can lead to various accidents, resulting in material loss and human injuries. This project presents a system to detect LPG leakage and alert the relevant personnel to prevent such accidents. The system uses an Arduino Uno, MQ2 gas sensor, and other components to detect and alert users of gas leakage.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Gas Detection**: Detects LPG, propane, methane, and other gases.
- **Immediate Alerts**: Activates an alarm and sends SMS alerts upon detection of gas leakage.
- **Safety Measures**: Prevents potential explosions and ensures house safety.

## 🧰 Components
- Arduino Uno
- MQ2 Gas Sensor
- Alphanumeric LCD 16x2
- Buzzer
- GSM Module
- Power Supply
- Connecting Wires
